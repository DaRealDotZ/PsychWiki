# Psych-Wiki
> **Note**: This is not the official wiki of Psych Engine

Welcome to PsychWiki! This is where we dedicate to documenting functions/other that is or not in official wiki with high quality descriptions and researching. This repository was made because the official wiki hasn't been updated for a while, so I decided to make my own wiki cuz why the hell not?

# Current Update [13.1.0 Version]
- Added the new `onEventPushed()` callback function, that's it.

# Previous Update [13.0.0 Version]
- Added "Global Functions & Variables" to `Lua Coding Docs`
- Added new variables from the "Variables" Page
- Added the description of the `allowMaps` parameter in the "Reflection Functions"
- Change the parameter for the `debugPrint()` function
- Revamp & Reformatted "Metatables" Page
- Revamp & Reformatted "Basics of Coding" Page
- Revamp "Custom Sprites & Texts Functions" Page
- Revamp "Tweens & Timer Functions" Page
- Fix spelling/grammar errors.
