# Psych-Wiki
> **Note**: This is not the official wiki of Psych Engine

Welcome to PsychWiki! This is where we dedicate to documenting functions/other that is or not in official wiki with high quality descriptions and researching. This repository was made because the official wiki hasn't been updated for a while, so I decided to make my own wiki cuz why the hell not?

# Current Update [12.0.0 Version]
- Added "Metatables" Page to `Lua Coding Docs`
- Added "Hscript Functions" Page to `Lua Script API`
- Added new functions
- Updated "Variables" **All Shortcut to** sections and added **Depracated Original Shorcuts** for compatability
- Updated "Tweens & Timers Functions" Page
- Revamp & Reformatted "Basics of Coding" Page
- Fixed the `_G` Variable Section description.
- Renamed "Matching Patterns" Page to "String Patterns"
- Renamed "Value Setters & Getters Function" to "Reflection Functions"
