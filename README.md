# Psych-Wiki
> **Note**: This not the official wiki of Psych Engine

Welcome to PsychWiki! This is where we dedicate to documenting functions/other that is or not in official wiki with high quality descriptions and researching. This repository was made because the official wiki hasn't been updated for a while, so I decided to make my own wiki cuz why the hell not?

# To-do List:
- [x] Finish the shader wiki
- [x] Add all the unmentioned callback
- [ ] Finish the `Lua Script Examples` folder

# Contributors:
- [kingyomoma](https://github.com/kingyomoma) - for fixing the grammar and additional context on `Basic of Coding` and `Custom Texts and Sprite`

# Credits:
- Shadow Mario - Main Programmer and the Creator of PsychEngine
- RiverOaken - Main Artist/Animator of PsychEngine
