# Psych-Wiki
> **Note**: This not the official wiki of Psych Engine

Welcome to PsychWiki! This is where we dedicate to documenting functions/other that is or not in official wiki with high quality descriptions and researching. This repository was made because the official wiki hasn't been updated for a while, so I decided to make my own wiki cuz why the hell not?

# Current Update [11.0 Version]
- Improve some descriptions on "Basics of Coding" and "Library Methofs" Pages
- Added a new page "Matching Patterns" in `Lua coding Docs`
- Added `loadFrames()` function in "Object Functions" Page
- Added `kbg` tag when representing characters cuz it looks cool
- Moved 'Escape Characters' Section to "Basics of Coding" Page
- Fix spelling/grammar errors.
- Renamed "Control Functions" into "Game Control Functions"
- Overhual `Lua Script Examples` folder
- Organized some sections in "Variables" and "Game Control Functions" Pages
